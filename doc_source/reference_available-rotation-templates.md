# AWS Templates You Can Use to Create Lambda Rotation Functions<a name="reference_available-rotation-templates"></a>

This section identifies the AWS managed templates that you can use to create a Lambda rotation function for your AWS Secrets Manager secret\. These templates are associated with the AWS Serverless Application Repository, which uses AWS CloudFormation to create 'stacks' of preconfigured resources\. In this case, they create a stack that consists of the Lambda function and an IAM role that Secrets Manager can assume to invoke the function when rotation occurs\.

**To create a Lambda rotation function with any of the following templates, you can copy and paste the ARN of the specified template into the CLI commands described in the topic [Rotating AWS Secrets Manager Secrets for Other Databases or Services](rotating-secrets-create-generic-template.md)\.**

Each of the following templates creates a Lambda rotation function for a different combination of database and rotation strategy\. The first bullet under each shows the database or service that the function supports\. The second bullet describes the rotation strategy that's implemented by the function\. The third bullet specifies the JSON structure that the rotation function expects to find in the `SecretString` value of the secret being rotated\.

## RDS MySQL Single User<a name="sar-template-mysql-singleuser"></a>

```
arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:297356227824:applications/SecretsManagerRDSMySQLRotationSingleUser
```
+ **Name:** SecretsManagerRDSMySQLRotationSingleUser
+ **Supported database/service:** MySQL database that's hosted on an Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) database instance\.
+ **Rotation strategy:** This changes the password for a user whose credentials are stored in the secret that's rotated\. For more information about this strategy, see [Rotating AWS Secrets Manager Secrets for One User with a Single Password](rotating-secrets-one-user-one-password.md)\.
+ **Expected `SecretString` structure:** 

  ```
  {
    "engine": "mysql",
    "host": "<required: instance host name/resolvable DNS name>",
    "username": "<required: username>",
    "password": "<required: password>",
    "dbname": "<optional: database name. If not specified, defaults to None>",
    "port": "<optional: TCP port number. If not specified, defaults to 3306>"
  }
  ```

## RDS MySQL Master User<a name="sar-template-mysql-masteruser"></a>

```
arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:297356227824:applications/SecretsManagerRDSMySQLRotationMultiUser
```
+ **Name:** SecretsManagerRDSMySQLRotationMultiUser
+ **Supported database/service:** MySQL database that's hosted on an Amazon RDS database instance\.
+ **Rotation strategy:** Two users are alternated during rotation by using the credentials of a separate master user, which is stored in a separate secret\. The user that's not currently active has its password changed before it's made the active user\. For more information about this strategy, see [Rotating AWS Secrets Manager Secrets by Alternating Between Two Existing Users](rotating-secrets-two-users.md)\.
+ **Expected `SecretString` structure:** 

  ```
  {
    "engine": "mysql",
    "host": "<required: instance host name/resolvable DNS name>",
    "username": "<required: username>",
    "password": "<required: password>",
    "dbname": "<optional: database name. If not specified, defaults to None>",
    "port": "<optional: TCP port number. If not specified, defaults to 3306>",
    "masterarn": "<required: the ARN of the master secret used to create 2nd user and change passwords>"
  }

+ **Expected `SecretString` structure:**
